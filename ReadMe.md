▶️ Usage

Export your API key as a variable in movies.py (or in an .env file if you extend it):

API_Key = "your_api_key_here"
    I added mine to a separate file, then imported it so I could exclude it with gitignore


Run the script:

python instance.py


Enter a movie/show title when prompted. Example:

Enter a movie to find:
Friday Night Lights
